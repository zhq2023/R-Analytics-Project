## Project 1: CO2 Emissions in Fuel Vehicles - Analysis and Modeling

### Introduction

The issue of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their impact on climate change has become a pressing concern worldwide. In the transportation sector, fuel vehicles are significant contributors to CO2 emissions. This data science project focuses on analyzing the factors associated with CO2 emissions from fuel vehicles.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze and understand the relationships between various factors and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fuel vehicles. The findings will contribute to the understanding of the factors influencing CO2 emissions from fuel vehicles.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project was derived from the Open Data from the Government of Canada and includes information about vehicles' characteristics and CO2 emission ratings.

### Methodology

The project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, training, and evaluation, as well as contingency table analysis and assumption checking.

## Project 2: World Happiness Report Analysis Using Multiple Linear Regression

### Introduction

The World Happiness Report reflects a new worldwide demand for more attention to happiness and absence of misery as criteria for government policy. This project aims to analyze the World Happiness Report from 2008 to 2022 using R, understand the parameters affecting a country’s people’s happiness, and establish a model to calculate world happiness scores.

### Statistical Methodologies

The dataset is sourced from the World Happiness Report, and various variables are used in the modeling process. The project involves linear regression, multicollinearity testing, stepwise regression, partial F-tests, and more.

### Modelling Plan

The plan includes handling multicollinearity, recommending a model of main effects, checking for higher-order terms and interactions, and testing model assumptions.

## Usage
